RAMSSD: Open-Channel SSD Simulator 

-- emulate open-channel SSDs in memory


RAMSSD is used for system evaluatation on Raw Flash Devices (a.k.a., Open-Channel SSDs).
The simulator is implemented based on FlashSim (Brendan Tauras from PSU).
Major ifferences between FlashSim and RAMSSD are:
(1) support open-channel SSD operations, and
(2) emulate the storage to keep the data in the memory (data contents are kept).
It has been used for the evaluation or the early evaluation (before using the real device) for our
research:

(This is the first work to propose the Open-Channel SSD for re-architecting flash storage systems.)

This simulator is part of our work Software Managed Flash (http://storage.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~lu/research/smf.html).
